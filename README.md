# Trans Frame

`Trans Frame` is a Chrome extension that enables translation by capturing images on web pages.

## User Story

As a user watching educational videos or presentations in a foreign language, I want to translate the vocabulary displayed on slides or in the video content into a language I understand better, so I can grasp the material more easily.
